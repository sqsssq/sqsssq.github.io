# Welcome, I am Qing Shi (石青).
<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently an MPhil student at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), under the supervision of <a href="https://www.mingmingfan.com/">Prof. Mingming Fan</a>. Before that, I obtained my B.Eng. degree from Zhejiang University of Finance and Economics, supervised by Prof. <a href="http://zhgzhou.hdvis.net/">Zhiguang Zhou</a> and Prof. Yuhua Liu. During the gap years, I worked as a Research Assistant at HKUST-CIVAL, HKUST (GZ) for 1.5 years, supervised by Prof. <a href="https://zeng-wei.com/">Wei Zeng</a>.

My research areas include **Data Visualization (VIS)**, **Visual Analytics (VA)**, and **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**, especially **Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)**. I published 7 research papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=K7LwtK0AAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2Fsqsssq%2Fsqsssq.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> in top-tier journals and conferences, such as IEEE TVCG, IEEE T-ITS, CGF, and IEEE VIS.
